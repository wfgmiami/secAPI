Ways to get data out of SEC EDGAR:

Method 1. Submissions Endpoint (submissions.json)
https://data.sec.gov/submissions/CIK{cik}.json

Method 2. Fetching and Parsing XBRL Directly - deiXBRLfile.py file for code reference
https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/16918/000001691823000005/0000016918-23-000005-index.htm
https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/16918/000001691823000005/stz-20230531_htm.xml

Method 3. Using the SEC’s Company Concept API
https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyconcept/CIK/{taxonomy}/{concept}.json

Pre-Aggregated Data - Efficient for Trends
-This API directly fetches historical data for the specified XBRL concept (e.g., CommonStockSharesOutstanding).
=Returns data across all filings where the concept is reported.
-You get a ready-made JSON response with the shares outstanding values over multiple filings,
eliminating the need to manually process individual filings.

dei:EntityCommonStockSharesOutstanding

dei stands for Disclosure Elements for Industry and is a namespace used in XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language). 
XBRL is a standardized format for digital reporting of financial data, commonly used in SEC filings such as 10-K and 10-Q. 
The dei namespace contains elements that describe general company information and metadata required in financial reports.

Also Dei can be:
Document and Entity Information (DEI) taxonomy data. DEI tags are used for 
general company-related information (such as company name, CIK, fiscal year, shares outstanding, etc.).

Feature	Submissions (Parsing Text) (method 1)         vs XBRL (Structured Data) (method 2)
Ease of Use:
Requires manual or programmatic text parsing.         vs Directly identified and easy to extract.

Reliability:
Depends on text format consistency.	                  vs Highly reliable due to standardized taxonomy.

Tools Needed:
HTML/text parsers (e.g., BeautifulSoup).	          vs XBRL/iXBRL parser (e.g., arelle, lxml).

Speed	
Slower due to the need for keyword searches.          vs Faster as the data is pre-tagged.

Use Case	
For non-XBRL filings or filings that don’t tag data.  vs For filings with XBRL data (10-K, 10-Q).



(XBRL Parsing) (method 2)	           vs   Company Concept API (method 3)
Scope	
Single filing (specific 10-K/10-Q).	        Multiple filings (historical trends).

Ease of Use	
Requires locating and parsing XBRL files.	Simplified JSON API response.

Data Availability	
All XBRL tags in the filing.	            Limited to specific XBRL tags (e.g., shares).

Use Case	
Deep dive into one filing's details.	    Quick analysis of trends over time.

Effort Required	
High (manual navigation/parsing).	        Low (automated pre-processed data).

Flexibility	
High (full XBRL data available).	        Medium (restricted to pre-aggregated concepts).


===
As of 2018, all publicly traded companies in the U.S. are required to file their 10-Q (quarterly reports) 
and 10-K (annual reports) in XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) format through the SEC's EDGAR system.

===
When filings are submitted to the SEC, they can have multiple formats or associated files. 
The structure of the URL can indicate whether you're dealing with:
HTML files (e.g., the main index page for a filing) Example: 0000016918-24-000178-index.htm
XML/XBRL files (for structured data) Example: 0000016918-24-000178_htm.xml

Issues with accessing XBRL files -

<Message>The specified key does not exist.</Message>

It's possible that the XBRL file you're looking for doesn't use the _htm.xml format. 
Instead, the XBRL data might be available in a different format or with a different naming convention
Not every filing is accompanied by an XBRL file, even though the SEC requires XBRL data for some types of filings 
(like 10-Q and 10-K). 
It's possible that this particular filing does not have an XBRL file available for download, 
or it might be in a different format.

Several reasons why some companies might not have data available 
when querying the SEC's Company Concept API (e.g., for CommonStockSharesOutstanding) using:
https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyconcept/CIK{cik}/us-gaap/CommonStockSharesOutstanding.json


===
What is the difference between getting outstanding shares using below

companyFacts = requests.get(
    f"https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyfacts/CIK{cik}.json", headers=headers
)
companyFacts.json()["facts"]["dei"]["EntityCommonStockSharesOutstanding"]["units"]

and using below
   companyConcept = requests.get(
            (
                f"https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyconcept/CIK{cik}"
                f"/us-gaap/{shareType}.json"
            ),
            headers=headers,
        )

 1. Using companyfacts (DEI Taxonomy) Endpoint: companyfacts     
 Key Concept: DEI data focuses on high-level entity information about the company, not detailed financials.

 2. Using companyconcept (US GAAP Taxonomy) Endpoint: companyconcept
 Key Concept: The companyconcept endpoint allows you to query specific concepts defined by US GAAP, 
 such as revenue, assets, liabilities, or shares outstanding under specific reporting contexts.

Which One to Use?
For General Information: If you're just interested in high-level company details, such as the number of shares outstanding
without needing the underlying financial context, then the companyfacts endpoint (DEI) is sufficient.
- Issues with companyFacts:
1. STZ did not have "EntityCommonStockSharesOutstanding" but "EntityPublicFloat"
 - EntityPublicFloat seems to be USD (dollar values), not unit shares
 - There were only 4 old 10-Q available

For Detailed Financial Reporting: If you need detailed financial data for analysis, especially in the context of financial
statements under US GAAP, then the companyconcept endpoint is more appropriate. 
It allows you to access specific financial concepts (e.g., shares outstanding in relation to other financial data).

There are several reasons why some companies might not have data available 
when querying the SEC's Company Concept API (e.g., for CommonStockSharesOutstanding) using:
https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyconcept/CIK{cik}/us-gaap/CommonStockSharesOutstanding.json

1. The Company Does Not File XBRL Data for That Concept
Reason: Not all companies report us-gaap:CommonStockSharesOutstanding explicitly in their filings. 
While XBRL tagging is required, some companies may report the same information under different tags or concepts 
(e.g., custom tags).
The Company Concept API only works with standard tags like us-gaap:CommonStockSharesOutstanding. 
Custom tags are not included.

2. Shares Outstanding May Be Reported Indirectly
Reason: Some companies do not explicitly tag shares outstanding using XBRL concepts like CommonStockSharesOutstanding.
Instead:
Shares outstanding may be included in narrative text (e.g., footnotes, tables) without being separately tagged.
The Company Concept API cannot retrieve untagged or narrative data.

3. Foreign Private Issuers and Form 20-F Filers
Reason: Foreign private issuers that file annual reports on Form 20-F or other forms may not use the same XBRL taxonomy.
Details:
These companies may use the IFRS taxonomy (instead of US GAAP).
The API only works for filings tagged using the US GAAP taxonomy, so the data won't be available for such companies.

4. Data Might Be Missing for Specific Filing Periods
Reason: A company might fail to report or tag shares outstanding in certain filings (e.g., older filings, incomplete filings).
Details:
Incomplete or amended filings may not include all required tags.
Shares outstanding might not have been consistently reported in earlier years when XBRL tagging 
requirements were less stringent (pre-2018 for smaller companies).

Copy code
https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyconcept/CIK{cik}/us-gaap/CommonStockSharesOutstanding.json
Here are the main reasons:

1. The Company Does Not File XBRL Data for That Concept
Reason: Not all companies report us-gaap:CommonStockSharesOutstanding explicitly in their filings. While XBRL tagging is required, some companies may report the same information under different tags or concepts (e.g., custom tags).
Details:
Instead of us-gaap:CommonStockSharesOutstanding, the company may use a custom taxonomy like abc:SharesOutstanding.
The Company Concept API only works with standard tags like us-gaap:CommonStockSharesOutstanding. Custom tags are not included.
2. Shares Outstanding May Be Reported Indirectly
Reason: Some companies do not explicitly tag shares outstanding using XBRL concepts like CommonStockSharesOutstanding. Instead:
Shares outstanding may be included in narrative text (e.g., footnotes, tables) without being separately tagged.
The Company Concept API cannot retrieve untagged or narrative data.
3. Foreign Private Issuers and Form 20-F Filers
Reason: Foreign private issuers that file annual reports on Form 20-F or other forms may not use the same XBRL taxonomy.
Details:
These companies may use the IFRS taxonomy (instead of US GAAP).
The API only works for filings tagged using the US GAAP taxonomy, so the data won't be available for such companies.
4. Data Might Be Missing for Specific Filing Periods
Reason: A company might fail to report or tag shares outstanding in certain filings (e.g., older filings, incomplete filings).
Details:
Incomplete or amended filings may not include all required tags.
Shares outstanding might not have been consistently reported in earlier years when XBRL tagging requirements were less stringent (pre-2018 for smaller companies).
5. Company Did Not File as Publicly Traded
Reason: Companies that recently went public or were private during earlier periods may not have historical filings tagged with shares outstanding.
Details:
For companies that recently IPO’d, data may only be available for filings after going public.
6. Query Errors or CIK Mismatch
Reason: If the CIK is incorrect or if there's a mismatch in the company identifier, the API will not return any data.
Details:
The Company Concept API is sensitive to accurate CIKs and standard tags. Ensure the CIK matches the company's SEC records.

How to Work Around This
Option 1: Use Custom Taxonomies
Check the company’s XBRL filing manually (via the submissions.json endpoint or XBRL instance file) to determine if they use
a custom tag for shares outstanding.
Example: Instead of us-gaap:CommonStockSharesOutstanding, the company may use something like abc:CommonSharesOutstanding.

Option 2: Parse Text in Filings
If XBRL data is unavailable, look for shares outstanding in the narrative sections of the filings 
(e.g., "Capitalization Table" or "Common Stock Outstanding").

Option 3: Explore Other APIs or Data Sources
For foreign issuers or companies with inconsistent filings, try querying other forms like DEF 14A (proxy statements), 
which also often include shares outstanding.
